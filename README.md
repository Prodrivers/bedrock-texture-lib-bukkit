# BedrockTextureLib

Helper plugin that parses Bedrock resource packs and maps resource/texture paths to Bukkit/Spigot/Paper materials.

Previously, this was a plugin providing custom integration between Java and Bedrock clients based on Geyser, with a focus on decoupling plugins from Geyser. Please the new Floodgate API for this.
